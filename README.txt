Description:
This project was made as a tool for visualizing sorting algorithms. This app allows users to
select between different sorting algorithms and view the sort in real time through animation. The
user has the option to change the size of the sorted array and the speed of the sort to suit his or
her needs. With a clean and easy to navigate GUI the user can learn about these sorting
algorithms with ease.

Known Bugs:
- None at this time :)

Version/Requirements:
- Currently using Intellij, as of now have not tested with Eclipse port.
